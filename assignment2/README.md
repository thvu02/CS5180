# Assignment 2 - CS 5180

## Summary
- Students practice writing NoSQL queries for MongoDB database using MongoDBCompass and Mongosh (MongoDB's shell)
- Students learn how to access and interact with MongoDB databases using Python via PyMongo library

## Questions
- (Problem #3) Is my datetime format correct
- (Problem #3) index_mongo.py imports the Python file db_connection_mongo_solution.py while the skeleton we are provided is named db_connection_mongo_solution.py. Students are explicitly told not to modify index_mongo.py, so what should they do?
- (Problem #3) Aside from outputting the inverted index ordered by term (AKA have keys in alphabetical order), is there any particular concern on the order the documents are listed for any word (e.g. 'summer': 'California:1, Arizona:1, Exercise:1' VS. 'summer': 'Arizona:1, California:1, Exercise:1')
